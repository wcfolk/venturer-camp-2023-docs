You will need to complete this stage first. After you have been approved to book, you will be able to log in and edit your booking.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Go to \href{https://bookings.venturercamp.org.uk/}{\texttt{bookings.venturercamp.org.uk}}.
    \item Click \verb|login|

        \label{fig:login}

    Next to the login button is a dark/light mode toggle. This will change the theme of the app to be either dark or light. For simplicity, all screenshots in this guide will be in light mode.
    \item Select one of the methods to login using.

    \item Follow instructions on screen for how to login using your method of choice.
    \item When you have successfully logged in, you will be redirected back to a screen similar to Figure \ref*{fig:login}, except your (or the account you are using) name will appear in the place of Guest.
    \item Click \verb|Apply to book|.

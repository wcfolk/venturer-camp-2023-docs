Once you have booked, you will be assigned a booking reference. This will be in the format \verb|VC23-xxxx|, where \verb|xxxx| will be replaced with a random 4-digit code. This is used to uniquely identify your booking. You \textbf{must} use it when paying so we are able to identify the money as coming from you and deducting it from your outstanding balance.

\section{How to pay}
Where possible, please pay by bank transfer. Where this is not possible, please contact us via \href{mailto:info@venturercamp.org.uk}{\texttt{info@venturercamp.org.uk}} to discuss alternatives.

Please put your unique \verb|VC23-xxxx| reference as your  payment reference.

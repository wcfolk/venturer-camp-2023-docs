    \chapter{Consent}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In Woodcraft Folk and at Venturer Camp, everyone has the right to feel welcome, feel comfortable and to feel safe.
        \item Everyone on site is expected to be friendly and to respect each other's boundaries.
        \item It is necessary to be aware that not everyone has the same boundaries as you, and to be sensitive and respectful to other people.
        \item Before sharing any intimate behaviour with another person (for example: hugs; sexual acts; or holding hands), you must have explicit consent.
        \item \textit{Consent} means positive affirmation.
        \item Consent is necessary for \textit{each and every} act. 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item ``No'' means no.
            \item Only ``yes'' means yes.
            \item The affirmation must be explicit and non-coercive.
            \item ``Maybe'', ``not yet'', ``I'm not sure'' do not count as giving consent.
            \item You must accept ``no'' either verbally or through body language as an answer without questioning the person's reasons.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Threatening and/or coaxing people into saying ``yes'' does not count as getting consent.
        \item A person can change their mind and withdraw consent at any time, this must be respected.
        \item If someone is intoxicated, or otherwise, they cannot consent.
        \begin{enumerate}

            \item You will be held equally responsible for your actions whether you are sober or otherwise.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Contraceptive products will be available for anyone of any age along with advice around safe sex practices. 
        \item We encourage attendees to look out for each other.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Don't be afraid to check in with someone and clarify if they are alright.
            \item If you are concerned about someone then contact:  your group leader; any adult you trust; a steward; village coordinator or member of the coordinating team.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item If you are concerned or upset by someone's behaviour, including breaking consent or disregarding personal boundaries, the Venturer Camp Safeguarding Team will take your concerns seriously and address them promptly.
        \item Any behaviour that breaks consent will be dealt with according to the Woodcraft Folk Safeguarding Policy, Woodcraft Folk Complaints Policy and Woodcraft Folk Grievances Policy.

    \bookTitle{Under 18 Volunteer Pricing}{Subtitle}{26th February 2023}{under-18-vol-pricing}
    \section{Introduction}
    Woodcraft Folk is committed to reducing barriers to volunteering. As part of this, those aged 18 and over at Venturer Camp are being identified as Volunteers. The Venturer Camp team recognise that volunteers will generally not have time to engage with the programme offered, and have decided to charge Volunteers a reduced rate to recognise their contribution, without which the camp would be unable to happen.

    The Venturer Camp team recognises that some young people aged under 18 may come to Venturer Camp in a Volunteer capacity, where this is the case they should not be charged the `participant' rate if they are not engaging with participant programme.

    This document will outline the expectations for those aged under 18 years coming as a Volunteer.

    \section{Who Is Eligible?}
    The Venturer Camp 2023 coordination team recognises that there are different voluntary roles, each with different commitments before, during and after camp. The coordination team does not wish to display favouritisim for one team of volunteers over another as all volunteers are equally as important in making the camp a success.

    Anyone ages under 18 is eligible for a reduced price place at camp, where they are taking on a \textit{significant} voluntary role. A voluntary role is classed as significant when:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the role is the persons primary focus on site;
        \item the role will require the majority of the persons time on site for at least 5 days of camp (or 70 \% of their time on site if they are not on site for the whole event);
    \end{itemize}
    
    \section{Applying For A Reduced Price Place}
    Assigning an under 18 year old a volunteer priced place is at the discretion of the Camp Coordinator. Applications should be sent to \href{mailto:info@venturercamp.org.uk}{\texttt{info@venturercamp.org.uk}} at the time of applying to book or booking, should it be part of a larger booking.

    The decision will be communicated via email to the booking contact, and the price reduction will be manually configured on the booking system. The booking contact will be able to login to the booking system to view the updated invoice. 

    \section{On-Site Practicalities}
    For Safeguarding purposes, the young person will still require a designated leader. The volunteering young person will still count towards the leaders ratio of adults to young people.

    Young people taking on voluntary roles will be given both the over-18 and under-18 wristband. It will be clearly communicated to volunteers on site what this means.

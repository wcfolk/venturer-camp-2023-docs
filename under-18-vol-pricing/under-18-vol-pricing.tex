    \bookTitle{Under 18 Volunteer Pricing}{A guide to being under 18 and volunteering at Venturer Camp}{26th February 2023}{under-18-vol-pricing}
    \section{Introduction}
    Venturer Camp 2023 has expanded age ranges to include anyone aged 13-17 inclusive as a participant, this is due to the Covid Pandemic. By default, anyone attending the camp who is under 18 will be classified as a participant and charged the participant fee; and those who are aged 18 and above will be attending the camp as a volunteer and they will be charged the volunteer fee. There is an option for young people aged 16 or 17 to become a volunteer and be charged the volunteer fee. This document will outline the the process to do this and requirements of this. \\

    Volunteers are being charged a reduced rate as part of Woodcraft Folk's commitment to reduce barriers to volunteering. The Venturer Camp 2023 Coordination team understands that volunteers will generally not have time to engage with the programme offered, and have decided to charge volunteers a reduced to recognise their contribution, without which the camp would be unable to happen.\\

    Participants of the camp will still be expected to undertake small voluntary roles, as is expected at Woodcraft Folk Events as part of the cooperative nature of the organisation. 

    \section{Who Is Eligible?}
    The Venturer Camp 2023 coordination team recognises that there are different voluntary roles, each with different commitments before, during and after camp. The coordination team does not wish to display favouritisim for one team of volunteers over another as all volunteers are equally as important in making the camp a success.\\

    Anyone aged under 16 or 17 is eligible for a reduced price place at camp, if they are taking on a \textit{significant} voluntary role. A voluntary role is classed as significant when:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the role is the persons primary focus on site; and
        \item the role will require the majority of the persons time on site for at least 5 days of camp (or 70 \% of their time on site if they are not on site for the whole event);
    \end{itemize}
    
    \section{Applying For A Reduced Price Place}
    Assigning an under 18 year old a volunteer priced place is at the discretion of the Camp Coordinator. Applications should be sent to \href{mailto:info@venturercamp.org.uk}{\texttt{info@venturercamp.org.uk}} at the time of applying to book or booking, should it be part of a larger booking.\\

    The decision will be communicated via email to the booking contact, and the price reduction will be manually configured on the booking system. The booking contact will be able to login to the booking system to view the updated invoice. 

    \section{On-Site Practicalities}
    For Safeguarding purposes, the young person will still require a designated leader. The volunteering young person will still count towards the leaders ratio of adults to young people.\\

    Young people taking on voluntary roles will be given both the over-18 and under-18 wristband. It will be clearly communicated to volunteers on site what this means.

\chapter{International Volunteers}
After Brexit, organisations in the UK are no longer eligible to participate in the European Solidarity Corps (ESC) programme run by the European Commission. Common Ground (2022 International Camp) was supported by a 15-strong team of ESC volunteers and as such, it was hoped that Venturer Camp 2023 would also be able to be supported by a number of international volunteers as those at Common Ground proved extremely valuable to the team.\\

Woodcraft Folk worked with a UK-based charity called Concordia to manage the recruitment of volunteers. A further evaluation of how this worked, what went well and what didn't work can be found in the Concordia chapter.

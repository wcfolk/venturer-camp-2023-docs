\chapter{Other Relevant Documents}

There are many more relevant documents which it would have been nice to include in the Appendix of this Report, but as the report \& current appendicies are already far longer than planned - here's a list of documents organisers of future camps may find it useful to refer to.\\

Many of these documents have been typeset using \LaTeX{} and therefore can be found in the \href{https://github.com/wcfolk/venturer-camp-2023-docs}{\texttt{venturer-camp-2023-docs}} repository on GitHub

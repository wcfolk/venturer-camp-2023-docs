\chapter{Budget \& Finance}

Before we were able to recruit a volunteer treasurer, Debs drew up a draft budget. This is yet to come to General Council/ Finances \& General Purposes Committee for approval.\\

The draft budget takes into considerations costs from Venturer Camp in 2019 as well as costs from Common Ground and inflation. There have been a number of revisions to the budget to include additional categories as the camp planning and planning for events leading up to the camp have progressed.

The budget has been designed such that we should break even.\\

The current budget is designed for 400 participants, 300 of those paying full price. The other 100 will be volunteer places who will be paying the reduced volunteer price.\\

The full budget has been included in the appendix.

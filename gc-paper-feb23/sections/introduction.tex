\chapter{Introduction}

Venturer Camp will be taking place between the 5th and 12th August 2023 at Biblins Campsite, Herefordshire. These dates were chosen to align with the Scottish term dates as well as the Finnish International camp dates. The team has access to various areas of Biblins between the 1st and 16th August 2023. We do not have sole use of the campsite during the setup/ takedown days, we do have sole use of the site for the Venturer Camp dates.\\

Broadly speaking, the camp is in a good place. People have been found for the majority of the core roles, a few outstanding roles remain unfilled however these are much smaller roles which are less critical to fill. Teams have begun to plan their components of the camp, with some further ahead than others.\\

Millie, Events Assistant, has been invaluable in handling the booking of essential services/ equipment and her focus will now shift to supporting teams with their individual tasks. She has also been extremely valuable with her communications experience to support with creating communications material as we are yet to recruit for a communications rep.

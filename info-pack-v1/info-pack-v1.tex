\chapter{Introduction}
Welcome to info pack v1!\nl

This info pack comes to you a bit later than originally anticipated, but fear not as it is crammed full of useful information about Venturer Camp!\nl

As of writing this section, we're sitting at a whopping 265 bookings! If you haven't booked yet and you would like to, be quick as bookings close on 26th May 2023.\\
Camp costs £150 for those aged under 18 and £50 for those aged 18 and up.\nl

If you've got a question or would like to know some more information, feel free to drop us a DM on our social media or send us an email (\href{mailto:info@venturercamp.org.uk}{\texttt{info@venturercamp.org.uk}}).

\section{Venturer Camp 2023, a reminder}
Back for 2023, Venturer Camp will once again be returning to Woodcraft Folk's Biblins Youth Campsite in Wye Valley near Hereford from the 5th to 12th August 2023. Venturer Camp is open to participants aged 13-17 due to the Covid pandemic and will have the theme of Mythology. 

\section{Find Out More}
Venturer Camp lives across the internet. You can find out more about us on our website (\href{https://venturercamp.org.uk}{\texttt{venturercamp.org.uk}}), on the Woodcraft website (\href{https://woodcraft.org.uk}{\texttt{woodcraft.org.uk}}), on our Instagram (\href{https://www.instagram.com/venturercamp/}{\texttt{@venturercamp}}) and on our Facebook (\href{https://www.facebook.com/wcfventurercamp}{\texttt{/wcfventurercamp}}).
We will also send emails to those who have booked and to Venturer group contacts with key information in it.

\section{Future Publications}
We are aiming to publish Info Pack v2 by 15th June 2023. This will contain most of the information which you will need before you come to camp including the finalised kit list; finalised travel information; expectations of villages including central camp clan jobs and village officeholder roles; and lots more!\\
We will be publishing the preliminary village handbook by 16th July. This will be provided in a printed form to villages on site. 

\chapter{Pre-Camp}
Venturer Camp 2023 will be hosting the majority of its pre-camp sessions online to save money, reduce the environmental impact and make them more accessible!\nl

We will also be hosting an on-site weekend in early July to finalise logistics.

\section{Virtual Pre-Camp}
Virtual sessions will be held each week from 17th April to the end of June through Zoom. Each session has a different topic and recordings of the sessions along with any presentations used will be made available on our website.\nl 

Upcoming sessions can be found on the \href{https://venturercamp.org.uk/calendar/}{calendar page of our website}.

\section{On-Site Pre-Camp}
On-Site Pre-Camp will take place from the 30th June - 2nd July at Biblins Youth Campsite. \nl

The weekend will not be a taster of the camp, it will be an opportunity for up-to one leader and one venturer (or one person from a non-venturer containing booking) to visit the site, review logistics and meet with other leaders who will be in your village!\nl

Information on booking for on-site pre-camp will be sent to booking contacts by mid-May. 

\chapter{Travelling To Site}
The full address of the site is as follows:\\
Biblins Youth Campsite\\
The Doward\\
Whitchurch\\
Ross-on-Wye\\
HR9 6DX\\
OS grid reference: SO 549 145

\section{Shuttle Buses}
We will have coaches from Hereford station to the camp on Saturday 5th August and from camp to Hereford station on Saturday 12th August. Unfortunately we won't be able to provide any transport on the days in between.\nl

Organising the coaches is always a little chicken and egg, as we know groups want to organise trains to fit with the coaches but we also want to organise the coaches to both fit with train arrival times and ensure everyone who needs one has a seat. We know no one will be booking trains for a couple of months yet but it would be incredibly useful if groups could let us know if they are considering travelling by train so we can start to have a vague idea of who might need spaces on the coach. \nl

Please take a moment to email \href{mailto:coaches@venturercamp.org.uk}{\texttt{coaches@venturercamp.org.uk}} if you know you are, are likely to, or might be travelling by train on either Saturday and if you have it the rough number of people travelling and rough arrival time (this could be eg some time between 1 and 4 pm). We really don't mind very vague information, some knowledge will help us with planning.

If you have any questions about coaches please also do drop Jeni and David an email at \href{mailto:coaches@venturercamp.org.uk}{\texttt{coaches@venturercamp.org.uk}}

\section{Site Access}
The main site access track is unsuitable for coaches, vehicles weighing over 7.5 tonnes or vehicles over 6ft wide. There is a coach access route on the Gloucestershire side of the river which is graded and rated for 40 ton timber lorries. This can be used for coaches. Please note that all luggage/ equipment will need to be carried across the suspension bridge.\nl

If you require use of the coach access route, please contact the Coordination \& Event Admin team via \href{mailto:info@venturercamp.org.uk}{\texttt{info@venturercamp.org.uk}} as we will need to ensure the access gate is unlocked for you and co-ordinate the arrival of vehicles to ensure no traffic jams!

\chapter{Communications During The Event}
The Venturer Camp 2023 coordination team recognises that for many young people being away from home can be a nerve wracking experience both for the young people and for the parents/ carers of those young people.\nl

The site has extremely poor mobile network coverage, it should be expected that no mobile service is available on site. There is limited service a short walk away from the site, we anticipate that young people will walk to this location as part of their morning activities a few times throughout the event.\nl

In the case of a serious emergency, the Coordination \& Events Admin team can pass messages to participants \& volunteers at the camp. They will be contactable via the following methods:
\begin{table}[H]

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Contact methods during the event}
\end{table}

\section{WiFi Access}
There is extremely limited WiFi available at the site. This will only be available to those who present a legitimate requirement for needing access to it. Obtaining exam results is a legitimate reason - so all of those who are expecting their Scottish Higher results on August 9th will be given access on that day.

\section{Electricity Access}
There is no access to electricity for the general population at camp. Participants and Volunteers should ensure they bring enough portable charging capabilities to last the duration of the event.

\chapter{Equipment}
\section{Village Kit}
A number of local districts/ districts camping at Biblins before or after Venturer Camp's kit will be used to supply the four villages with kit.\nl

The central camp will contribute to the cost of hiring a van to move their kit so there is no expectation for groups within the village to contribute to this.\nl

The Coordination \& Event Administration team will be in contact with the kit providing districts to coordinate transportation/ storage on site.

\section{Sleeping Tents}
It is expected that all participants \& volunteers provide their own sleeping tents. It may be the case that participant/ volunteer's district will provide enough tents for all to sleep in, or that individuals are expected to bring their own.\nl

If bringing sleeping tents for yourself/ your delegation to camp is a problem, please get in touch with the Coordination \& Event Administration team via \href{mailto:info@venturercamp.org.uk}{\texttt{info@venturercamp.org.uk}}.

\chapter{Programme}
Below is an itinerary for Venturer Camp! Please note this is subject to change, we have included it to give you an idea of what will happen during the week but timings are not confirmed yet. \nl

There is no central programme in the mornings to give you a chance to bond and do clan in your villages. You should decide together when to do breakfast, morning circle, lunch, clan, and if you wish village activities, just make sure there's time to fit everything in before central activities start at 14:30! Each village will also be allocated one day where all their participants get the chance to do either canoeing or climbing (or maybe both subject to final numbers), and this will include a morning and an afternoon session, so there will be one day where your village has central programme in the morning as well as the afternoon.
